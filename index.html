                  <p class="about-title">He is described as an accomplished F-Zero pilot and renowned bounty hunter. In F-Zero X, it is rumored that his title of Captain came about because he used to be an officer on the Internova Police Force. By the age of 36, Captain Falcon had built a reputation as one of the best bounty hunters in the galaxy, this has earned him many enemies. the constant danger forces him to live in a sanctuary on a chain of islands off the coast of Port Town, this is where he is usually. he likes being alone so much that even after winning a race, he takes his award and quickly leaves to his house.</p>
